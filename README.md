# Amazon-Webscrape

A amazon webscraper app utilizing Python, BeautifulSoup from bs4, Csv, Pandas, and Webdriver from Selenium
Enter a search for amazon and this program will search through amazon and puts it all into a csv file and an excel file
They will show the product description, price, rating, number of ratings, and the url to the listing


**Future Implementaions**
- ~~Turn csv into excel so sort easier~~
- Fix the weird terminal issue with the webdriver
- Make a gui
- Maybe organize by rating
